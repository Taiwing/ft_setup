- make it so the script works on any linux machine, not just on 42
  (create an exception for 42)

- explicitly add other fundamental depencies like vim9, tmux, git
- add needed vim plugins
- work on setting up firefox with the extensions and eventually fetch
  history and bookmarks somewhere
- think of other stuff I might need when setting up a new machine
